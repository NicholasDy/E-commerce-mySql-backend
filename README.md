## Project Title; E-Commerce Backend

## Description of App; 
This app is the basic layout of an ecommerce database. The videos below go over the basic funtionality of the database construction and the implemtation of the routes using Insomnia. A user is able to create categories, product and product tags in the database. The puprose of the app is to operate as a system to hold information that is important to the user for their e-commerce storefront. The basics of the information can be later expanded on and used in further implementations of the app.
